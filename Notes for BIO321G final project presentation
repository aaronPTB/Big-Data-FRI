Notes for final project presentation

1. Background on Data Set:
	data set is gene expression (rna-seq)
	samples are different tissue types
		maybe image/list of different tissue types?
	"has been set up to allow for a systematic exploration of the human proteome using antibody-based proteomics."
	"The main objective of the resource centre is to produce specific antibodies to human target proteins using a high-throughput production method involving the cloning and protein expression of Protein Epitope Signature Tags (PrESTs)"
	Use one/more of the figures in the original papers?

2. Analysis Aims
	We wanted to train a model for classifying tissue type based on gene expression levels (from rna-seq data).
	The questions we wanted to answer were:
		How does gene expression vary across tissue types?
		Are there sub-types of tissues, or are there tissue types that have similar gene expression levels?
		What applications or generalizations could a model for classifying tissue type be applied to?

3. Analysis Plan
	We intended to use a machine learning approach.
		However, none of us has significant background knowledge in that field
		So we started by doing research on a library scikit-learn which provides methods for data analysis through machine learning.
	One of the techniques we discovered was principal components analysis:
		go into description of PCA and how it applies...
	So we wrote code (using scikit-learn) to perform a PCA reduction on our dataset and got these results
		show figures, 2D of first and second component, 3D of first three components, maybe 2D of second and third components

4. Results
	show figures created from PCA
	discuss how the results from PCA could be useful in future research/development of a classification model
		clustering from PCA essentially proves that classification in the manner we wish is possible!
